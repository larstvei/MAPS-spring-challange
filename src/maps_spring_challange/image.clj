;; This image is the poster for the MAPS Spring Challenge as shown on the
;; IFI info screens. The background is a nice shade of green, namely RGB
;; #5B9836. Somewhere hidden in this image is the portrait of a famous
;; celebrity, painted in a slightly different shade of green, namely RGB
;; #5A9836.
;;
;; We want to know the nickname (which typically is used as his/her first
;; name), in lower case, of this celebrity. This nickname is also hidden in
;; the image below the portrait, for your convenience.
