;; We are now interested in some special 4x4 matrices that have the following properties:
;;
;; * All elements are integers from 1 through 7 (inclusive)
;; * The sum of each row and each column must all be the same
;; * The sum of all elements in the entire matrix is twice the sum of the
;;   two diagonals
;;
;; How many distinct 4x4 matrices have all these three properties?
